Binary heap implementaion

Notes:
-- Removed macro templating since the non-idiomaticness was getting on my nerves
-- Note, bheap_push needs the address of the value you are trying to push
   in order to be type agnostic. Thus, it is not possible to push temporaries.
   You need to do something like
   int tmp;
   tmp = 10, bheap_push(&myBheap, &tmp);
   tmp = 20, bheap_push(&myBheap, &tmp);
   Instead of the usual
   bheap_push(&myBheap, 10);
   bheap_push(&myBheap, 20);

   (Yes, I know the bheap_test.c doesn't reflect this. I wrote it when bheap.h was still macro templated)
