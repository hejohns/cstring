Note:
-- O(sqrt n) reversals
-- O(log n) lookups

This is a very niche container. 
It is essentially a two-level tree using a vector of deques.
It only pays off if the number of reversals
heavily outweighs the number of lookups. The access benchmarks that lookup time
is roughly 100x slower than a vector, especially when iterating over the container
since the internal representation is hardly contiguous in memory.

Might be useful someday? We'll see...
